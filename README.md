# TensorFlow-Practice

Personal practice, learning, and using TensorFlow, Keras, and other Deep Learning tools.

A workshop for me to grow as a data scientist and become more familiar with libraries such as pandas and numpy, as well as machine/deep learning. My goal is to become proficient with these tools, then develop skills in computer vision to process and model geoscientific imagery and data.
